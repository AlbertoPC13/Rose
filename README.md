This project is a grammatical analysis micro service module developed for the Prototype tool to support the initial stage of learning to write in the Spanish language.

# Documentation

The grammatical analysis module consists of a **Flask API** that receives a text and returns the grammatical analysis of the text performed by the nltk library and openai's **GPT-4 model**. 

The API has a single endpoint that receives a GET request with a JSON body containing the text to be analyzed. The API returns a JSON with the grammatical analysis of the text.
